# MCPE-SkinPacker
This is a PowerShell script to create MCPE skin pack from a folder.

Usage is as simple as possible. Just put all required skins (*.png) into some folder.
Name of the folder will be name of the skin pack.

Then just run PowerShell and run "**path_to_script**\CreateS" "**path_to_skins_directory**"

That's all - mcpack should be created near the script file.

If you want slim/girl skins - put your slim skins into the "**Slim**" subfolder (SkinsDir\Slim\slimskin.png).

Only classical skins are supported (classical humanoid geometry).

*Why I have idea to do it? Just because MCPE doesn't give a possibility to select custom skin on Android TV.*
